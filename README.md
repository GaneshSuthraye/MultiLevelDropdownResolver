## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a robust multi-level dropdown menu component. The current implementation includes various nested dropdowns for topics and subtopics, but it requires further refinement for better usability and cross-browser compatibility.

## Setup Instructions

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can interact with the multi-level dropdown menus and test various functionalities. Specifically, you can navigate through the nested dropdowns, such as selecting "Technology & Innovation" > "Coding & Development" > "Frontend Development." However, please note that there may be issues with displaying the nested items correctly, particularly under "Frontend Development." We encourage you to explore different scenarios and edge cases to help identify the root cause of the problem.
